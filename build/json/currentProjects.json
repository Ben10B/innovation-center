A review, and certification system will be created to help new users prove their worth and get more job requests. I'd like to see this website/application provide people with different ways to make money easily, besides YouTube, and being an Uber driver. Also with everyone having new ways to learn and teach, it'll hopefully make the world a slightly better place.",

    "description": "Signlate is a user-friendly, two-way translation app that will translate not only English to ASL but also ASL to English. It is meant to be a lifestyle app that can be tailored to the needs of its users. It uses 3D modeling, instead of actors, allowing it to be updated with new words and dialects. SignLate's main feature is how it allows you to look up a specific sign through keywords and tags to find its meaning in English. My future plans for the app are to implement Augmented Reality, and other languages such as British sign language, and Spanish sign language.",

    "description": "Several resources and platforms like Khan Academy, Udemy, and Pluralsight are available online in the strive to make education easier for students. With the new technological changes and innovations around the world, it is often difficult for educational organizations to provide students with updated resources to enhance student's future. Many platforms that offer additional resources on educational and professional subjects are often outdated, or not specific to most educational facilities. This process stagnates numerous student's progress towards their academic and career success. This proposed invention focuses on providing students a platform with resources, teacher's featuring tutorials, personal lock timer and a public messaging system between students and teachers for their academic purposes. This technology will boost student's motivation and focus to achieve their goals and develop their skills in various areas.",
